# Dependencies
- Matlab
- Yalmip
- MOSEK solver

# Procedure to run the code
1. To just run covariance steering with polytopic distributionally robust state risk constraints, run the matlab code `mainDRCS.m` which will load the required system data and generate the desired plots.
2. To run covariance steering with iterative risk allocation for polytopic distributionally robust state risk constraints, run the matlab code `mainCSDRRA.m` which will load the required system data and generate the desired plots.
3. For conic state risk constraints, run the matlab code `mainCSDR_CC.m` which will load the required system data and generate the desired plots.

## Variations while running `mainDRCS.m`, `mainCSDRRA.m` and `mainDRCS_CC.m` files
    * Set `riskSelectFlag = 1` in line `13` for running simulations with Gaussian chance constraints
    * Set `riskSelectFlag = 2` in line `13` for running simulations with Distributionally Robust risk constraints 
    * Set `dynamicsSelectFlag = 1` in line `14` for running simulations with 3D spacecraft dynamics
    * Set `dynamicsSelectFlag = 2` in line `14` for running simulations with Double Integrator dynamics
