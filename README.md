# Covariance Steering With Optimal Distributionally Robust (DR) Risk Allocation 
This repository contains the MATLAB code for simulating covariance steering for stochastic linear systems using optimal and distributionally robust risk allocation.

# Dependencies
- Matlab
- Yalmip
- MOSEK solver

# Procedure to run the code
1. For polytopic state risk constraints, run the matlab code `mainDRCS.m` which will load the required system data and generate the desired plots.
2. For conic state risk constraints, run the matlab code `mainDRCS_CC.m` which will load the required system data and generate the desired plots.

## Variations while running `mainDRCS.m` and `mainDRCS_CC.m` files
    * Set `riskSelectFlag = 1` in line `13` for running simulations with Gaussian chance constraints
    * Set `riskSelectFlag = 2` in line `13` for running simulations with Distributionally Robust risk constraints 
    * Set `dynamicsSelectFlag = 1` in line `14` for running simulations with 3D spacecraft dynamics
    * Set  `dynamicsSelectFlag = 2` in line `14` for running simulations with Double Integrator dynamics
